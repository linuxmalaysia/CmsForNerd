## 🛠️ Installation & Laboratory Setup

### 🪟 Option 1: Windows 11 (Recommended for Beginners)

The most efficient setup on Windows uses the "Nerd-Stack":

1. **Engine:** Install [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com) and select **PHP 8.4**.
2. **CLI:** Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com) (Enable symbolic links).
3. **Terminal:** Use **Google Antigravity** for high-speed CLI output.
4. **Action:** Clone the repo into your Herd `sites` folder and run `composer install`.
5. **Guide:** See the [Windows Setup Guide](windows-setup.php) for full details.

### 🐧 Option 2: Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, AlmaLinux)

For production-grade testing, use official repositories:

1. **Debian/Ubuntu:** Use [Ondřej Surý's PHP PPA](https://deb.sury.org/).
2. **AlmaLinux/RHEL:** Use the [Remi Repository](https://rpms.remirepo.net/).
3. **Permissions:** Ensure `www-data` or `apache` has read access to the project root.
4. **Action:** Install `php8.4-cli`, `php8.4-mbstring`, and `php8.4-xml`.
5. **Guide:** See the [Linux Setup Guide](linux-setup.php) for terminal commands.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

CMSForNerd v3.1 is designed to be co-authored with AI. We recommend the following synergy:

1. **Google Gemini (The Architect)**: Ask Gemini to plan your logic, refactor legacy functions, or explain complex RFC standards.
2. **Google Antigravity (The Agent)**: Use Antigravity to execute file writes, run compliance audits, and manage your Git workflow.
3. **Workflow**: Describe your desired change in natural language, review the
  `implementation_plan.md` generated by the AI, and verify with `composer compliance`.

See the [🤖 AI Development Guide](ai-dev.php) for the "Prompt-to-Product" methodology.

### VS Code & GitHub Copilot

If you prefer Visual Studio Code, we recommend using it with GitHub Copilot for an
interactive AI-assisted workflow. Minimal setup:

1. Install these recommended extensions:

* GitHub Copilot
* PHP Intelephense (or equivalent PHP language server)
* PHP CS Fixer or phpcbf integration (for quick style fixes)
* EditorConfig (to respect repository line endings and indentation)

1. Recommended workspace settings (add to `.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "files.eol": "\n",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client",
  "php.validate.executablePath": "php",
  "git.autofetch": true
}
```

1. Using Copilot effectively:

* Use natural language prompts in comments to describe the change, e.g. `// TODO: add unit test for sitemap generator`.
* Ask Copilot for small, focused edits (single-file changes or small feature additions). Run tests locally after applying suggestions.
* Prefer PRs for multi-file or cross-cutting changes; include a clear test/verification plan in the PR body.

1. Quick commands in VS Code terminal:

```powershell
composer install
composer fix-style   # apply phpcbf autofixes
composer compliance  # run style + tests
```

Keep Copilot suggestions under review — do not accept edits that change vendor
files, remove tests, or disable security checks without human approval.

## 💻 Recommended Stack

To get the most out of CMSForNerd, we recommend:

* **Editor:** Google Antigravity (Advanced AI Coding).
* **Server:** Nginx Latest with PHP 8.4+.
* **Browser:** Mozilla Firefox for testing strict privacy and modern web standards.
