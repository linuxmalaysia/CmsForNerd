# 📜 SOP: Ethical AI Integration

Standard Operating Procedure for the CMSForNerd v3.3 Laboratory.

## Objective
To utilize AI agents (Gemini, Antigravity) as **tutors and executors** while ensuring that students maintain complete ownership of the logic and security.

## The Rules of Engagement

### 1. Verification Loop
All AI-generated code must be audited using the built-in laboratory tools:
1. **Linting:** `composer fix-style`
2. **Testing:** `composer test`
3. **Audit:** `composer compliance`

### 2. Prohibited Actions
* **DO NOT** copy-paste code you cannot explain line-by-line during lab reviews.
* **DO NOT** ignore AI security warnings.
* **DO NOT** use AI to bypass the logic-heavy sections of the Final Exam.

## Learning Outcome
Mastering this SOP prepares you for a professional environment where AI collaboration is the standard, ensuring you remain the **Architect** of the system.
