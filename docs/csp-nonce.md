# 🛡️ Content Security Policy (CSP) Nonces

## The Problem: Inline Script Vulnerabilities
Traditional websites often allow `'unsafe-inline'` in their CSP to let internal scripts run. However, this allows attackers to inject their own scripts via URL parameters or form inputs.

## The Solution: Cryptographic Nonces
In **CMSForNerd v3.3**, we implement a "Number Used Once" (Nonce) strategy:

1. **Generation:** `SecurityUtils` creates a random 128-bit string on every page refresh.
2. **Declaration:** The string is sent in the HTTP response header or Meta tag.
3. **Execution:** The browser compares the `nonce` attribute on `<script>` tags to the one in the header.

### Mandatory Standards
* **RFC 2119 MUST:** A new nonce MUST be generated for every request.
* **RFC 2119 MUST NOT:** The nonce MUST NOT be predictable or reusable.
