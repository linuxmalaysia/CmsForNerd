# 🤖 AI Agent Skills Development Guide

This document serves as the central registry and learning guide for creating **AI Agent Skills** within our project infrastructure.

By packaging our operational knowledge into "Skills," we allow any autonomous AI agent (like Antigravity, OpenHands, Cursor, etc.) to instantly learn and execute complex, project-specific workflows without needing human supervision or long chat histories.

## 🏗️ What is an Agent Skill?
We adhere to the [AgentSkills.io Standard](https://agentskills.io). At its core, an Agent Skill is simply a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file.

This file acts as a "memory module" that the AI agent loads on-demand when a user asks a related question. It provides the agent with exact instructions, scripts, or architectural knowledge required to solve a problem safely.

## 📝 How to Create a New Skill

All custom skills for this project MUST reside in the `.agents/skills/` directory.

### Step 1: Create the Directory
Create a new, aptly named folder for your workflow:
```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills/my-custom-skill
```

### Step 2: Create the `SKILL.md` File
Create a `SKILL.md` file inside that folder. It **must** begin with YAML frontmatter containing the `name` and `description`.

*Note: The `description` is critical—the AI agent reads this description secretly in the background to decide if it should load the skill to help the user.*

```yaml
---
name: my-custom-skill
description: "A very clear, 1-2 sentence description explaining exactly when the AI should load this skill. (e.g., 'Use this skill when the user asks to deploy HAProxy...')"

# My Custom Skill Guide

## Purpose
Briefly explain what this achieves.

## Execution Steps
Provide clear, step-by-step markdown instructions.
1. Run command A.
2. Verify output B.
3. If error C happens, do D.
```

### Step 3: Test It
Once saved, simply ask your AI agent to perform the task described in the skill, and watch it flawlessly execute your codified logic!

## 🌐 Compatibility with OKF (Open Knowledge Format)
AgentSkills.io is a conceptual workflow standard (packaging scripts and logic inside a folder). It **does not conflict** with the Open Knowledge Format (OKF). Instead, they are completely complementary. OKF simply enforces that the `SKILL.md` file contains standard YAML metadata so the skill can be programmatically indexed.
