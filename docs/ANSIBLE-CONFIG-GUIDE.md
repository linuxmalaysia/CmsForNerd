# [DOC] CmsForNerd Ansible Configuration Guide (v4.0.0)

## [TOOL] The Ansible Blueprint (`ansible.cfg`)

The `ansible.cfg` file is optimized for the **CmsForNerd Deployment Fabric**. Our Ansible orchestration engine is
designed to **autonomously detect the target OS (Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, RHEL, or Debian)** and focuses exclusively on the
deployment of a highly secure **Nginx** and **PHP-FPM 8.4+** stack:

* **Pipelining**: Enabled to reduce SSH handshake latency when deploying to remote Linux enclaves.
* **YAML Callback**: Standardized for high-fidelity human/AI audit of deployment steps, ensuring visibility into
  Composer outputs.
* **Privilege Escalation**: `become: true` configured at the task level strictly for OS tuning (Nginx, PHP-FPM 8.4
  installation, and firewall configuration).
* **Orchestrator User**: Ansible connects via a secure staging user (e.g., `lab-admin`) utilizing SSH keys.

## [SHIELD] The Doctrine: "Rootful Orchestration, Isolated Execution"

In v3.6.0, we enforce a strict separation of concerns to ensure production-grade security for the educational CMS:

* **Rootful Orchestration**: Ansible runs tasks requiring package management (Nginx, PHP 8.4, Composer) and directory
  creation (`/var/www/cmsfornerd`) as root (`become: yes`).
* **Isolated Execution**: The CMS itself is strictly executed via the unprivileged web server identity.
  * *Production Identity*: Strictly enforced via automated OS detection: **`www-data`** (Ubuntu/Debian) or **`nginx`**
    (AlmaLinux/RHEL).
  * *Development Identity*: Supports Windows 11 Laravel Herd (`haris`) for local simulation.
* **Sovereign Persistence**:
  * **Primary Web Root**: `/var/www/cmsfornerd/` (Native Linux ext4, strictly owned by the web identity).
  * **Security Boundaries**: `chmod 755` for directories and `chmod 644` for files. The `.git` folder is explicitly
    blocked via Nginx routing rules.
* **Zero-Global Guarantee**: Ansible playbooks execute `composer lab-check` locally on the deployment node prior to
  rotating symlinks to guarantee the Zero-Global PHPStan Level 8 baseline.

## [VAULT] Sovereign Secrets & Identity

* **Registry**: `vault/secrets.yml` (Git-ignored) storing potential deploy keys or SSL cert paths.
* **Identity (Production Fabric)**:
  * `ansible_user`: Set to `lab-admin` for secure VM access.
  * `ansible_become`: Must be `true` for infrastructure and Nginx restarts.
* **Ownership Sovereignty**:
  > **[BRAIN] Logic**: The CMS is database-free and requires write access *only* if flat-file editing is enabled. The
  > baseline ensures `/var/www/cmsfornerd` is owned by `www-data:www-data` so PHP-FPM can effectively route requests,
  > but modifications must be pulled via Git tracking, never edited directly on the production host.
* **No .env Bloat**: Because CmsForNerd relies on architectural simplicity and `bootstrap.php` constants, we avoid
  heavy environment file synchronization in Ansible.

## 🌐 Core Routing Ports

### 🛡️ Security Hierarchy

| Port    | Service     | Role         | Data Flow                                   |

---

## [SPEED] Phase 1: Reanimation & Deployment Sequence

1. **Sync Hierarchy**: Tier 1 (Windows Herd) -> Run `composer lab-check` -> Tier 2 (Ansible Node).
2. **OS Hardening**: Deploy `common` role (Rootful Tuning, Firewall Port 80/443 mapping).
3. **Application Engine**: Deploy `php` role (PHP 8.4 CLI/FPM, MBString, XML extensions, Composer).
4. **Web Proxy**: Deploy `webserver` role (Nginx configuring strict routing interceptors to drop `.inc` and
   `.git` requests).
5. **Repository Sync**: Deploy `cmsfornerd` role (Git shallow clone `master` branch, enforce `www-data` ownership).
6. **Sovereign Pulse**: Execute health check `curl -I https://localhost/` confirming the dual-view router (`pager.php`)
   is responding mathematically at 200 OK.
