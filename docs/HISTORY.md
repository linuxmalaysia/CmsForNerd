# 📜 Modernization History

Tracking the evolution of **CMSForNerd** from a legacy flat-file system to a modern educational powerhouse.

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 16: Root Workspace Cleanliness Mandate (v4.1.6)

- **Repository Root Cleanup**: Cleaned up the repository root directory by moving all unrelated markdown files to the `docs/` Palace.
- **Critical Entry Points**: Retained only core configuration files and critical entry-point documents (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) in the root.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Deleted duplicate identical uppercase files (`DIRECTORY_SECURITY.md`, `DOCS_REQUIREMENTS.md`) inside `docs/` to eliminate redundancy and maintain a single source of truth.
- **Reference Updates**: Updated all internal documentation and sitemap links across `README.md` and `SUMMARY.md` to map cleanly to their new paths inside the `docs/` Palace.

### Phase 15: DSOM Node Bootstrap & OpenSCAP Compliance Hardening

- **Dual-Play Transition Playbook**: Developed `playbooks/bootstrap_node.yml` to orchestrate secure rootful user provisioning and baseline setup.
- **Dynamic SCAP Content Retrieval**: Implemented auto-download of the latest ComplianceAsCode definitions.
- **CIS Level 2 Auditing and OVAL Scanning**: Configured multi-platform compliance auditing for Ubuntu 24.04 and RHEL family.
- **Unified Compliance reporting**: Set up automatic extraction of Lynis and OpenSCAP compliance scores to build a unified report.

### Phase 14: Podman 5+ Native Migration & Google Jules Setup

- **Ubuntu 26.04 Standardisation**: Integrated support for Ubuntu 26.04 (Plucky Puffin), the first stable OS natively shipping
  with Podman 5.x.
- **Pure Podman Migration**: Renamed and migrated all legacy Dockerfile and docker-compose assets to Podman-native Containerfile and
  compose.yml configurations.
