# 📜 Modernization History

Tracking the evolution of **CMSForNerd** from a legacy flat-file system to a modern educational powerhouse.

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 5: Modernization Mastery (v3.5)
* **Zero-Global Architecture**: Complete elimination of `global` state in 30+ controllers.
* **Factory Pattern**: Refactored context initialization to `createCmsContext()` with explicit dependency injection.
* **Documentation Sync**: 100% alignment of `docs/` with `contents/` logic and "State of Mind" philosophy.
* **Standardization**: Batch synchronization of all page controllers to v3.5 baseline.

### Phase 4: The Semantic Alignment (v3.4)
* **AI Readiness**: Modernized metadata layer with JSON-LD and Schema.org.
* **Theme Correction**: Standardized theme paths to `themes/CmsForNerd`.
* **Security Auditor**: Introduction of semantic audit tools for students.

### Phase 3: Runtime Stability (v3.3)
* **Centralized Bootstrap**: Introduction of `includes/bootstrap.php`.
* **Performance**: Standardized GZIP compression and output buffering.

### Phase 2: Laboratory Tooling (v3.2)
* **Cross-Platform**: Created specialized guides for Windows and Linux.
* **Responsible Disclosure**: Implemented `security.txt` and Security Policy.

### Phase 1: The PHP 8.4 Engine (v3.1)
* **Strict Typing**: Forced predictable code logic.
* **CmsContext**: Migration from Global variables to the Context Pattern.

## The v3.5 Journey: A Case Study

In 2026, **CMSForNerd v3.5** represents the pinnacle of "Radically Simple" engineering. This version finalizes the transition into a fully synchronized, AI-native developer's laboratory.

### 1. The PHP 8.4/9 foundation
Refactored the 2005 foundation into PHP 8.4+ classes with PHP 9 readiness.
* **Strict Types**: Every file uses `declare(strict_types=1);`.
* **State Management**: **Zero global variable usage** (enforced by `phpstan.neon`).

### 2. Standards & Compliance
* **PSR-12**: Automated linting and formatting (verified by `composer compliance`).
* **RFC 2119**: Clear requirement levels for students.

### 3. Security Hardening
* **Bunker Posture**: CSP Nonces, Cloudflare Turnstile, and Path Traversal prevention.
* **RFC 9116**: Proper vulnerability disclosure protocols.
