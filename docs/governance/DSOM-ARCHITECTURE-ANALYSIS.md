# The Deep State of Mind (DSOM) Framework: Defense-in-Depth Architecture

## Abstract

This document deconstructs the operational architecture of the **Deep State of Mind (DSOM)** framework, shifting the paradigm from a mere Git repository to a sovereign **Defense-in-Depth AIOps Engine**. Designed for high-availability IT operations, this framework positions an AI Cognitive Twin (The Senior ICT Consultant) at the core of a zero-trust infrastructure. The architecture forces deterministic behavior through strict spatial memory boundaries, procedural skill routing, and localized, self-healing orchestration patterns.

---

## 1. The Defense-in-Depth Operational Stack

The DSOM repository is not just code; it is a mapped representation of a multi-layered, zero-trust IT infrastructure environment, continuously audited by the Cognitive Twin.

### Layer 1: Perimeter, Web & Cryptography
- **Bunkerweb & Nginx:** The primary edge defenses preventing malicious traffic from reaching the internal application logic.
- **mTLS 1.3 & Zero-Trust:** Mutual TLS enforced across all node-to-node communications.
- **Smallstep CLI & PKI:** Automated, sovereign Certificate Authority management for post-quantum cryptography readiness.

### Layer 2: Compute Fabric & High Availability
- **K3s / RKE2 & Podman:** The core execution fabric. Orchestration is air-gapped where possible, running highly available distributed fabrics designed for resilience.
- **Percona PostgreSQL (Patroni) & Galera:** The data persistence layer. Etcd clusters are dedicated exclusively to Patroni to ensure flawless automated failovers and zero data loss.

### Layer 3: Security & Observability (AIOps)
- **Wazuh (SIEM/XDR):** The primary security nervous system, feeding logs and anomaly alerts back into the AI for correlation and automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA).
- **Elastic Observability:** Centralized log intelligence (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats) used by the AI to detect infrastructure degradation before failure occurs.
- **OpenSCAP & Lynis:** Continuous vulnerability scanning and server hardening audits embedded directly into the daily operational loops.

## 2. Structural Mapping of the Core Ecosystem

An analysis of the system architecture reveals how these Defense-in-Depth layers are managed through specific isolation namespaces.

## 3. Core Operational Cycles

The framework drives system operations through three distinct, deterministic runtime cycles:

```text
[ START OF DAY (SOD) ]
          |
          ▼
  • Read palace_registry.md
  • Initialize Git worktrees
  • Set isolated memory paths
          |
          ▼
[ PRODUCTION RUNTIME ] ────────► • Execute self-healing scripts
          |                      • Audit system logs (Wazuh, Elastic, AIOps)
          ▼                      • Sync infrastructure states
[  END OF DAY (EOD)  ]
          |
          ▼
  • Run privacy scans
  • Commit code modifications
  • Rebase and sync upstream
```

1. **Start of Day (SOD) Ritual:** The agent reads `palace_registry.md` to establish its baseline context, sets its path environment to the isolated workspace directory, and checks for upstream changes across open project branches.
2. **Production Runtime Loop:** Operations run via isolated subagent worktrees. The system uses self-healing scripts inside `.agents/skills/` to continuously monitor infrastructure state, manage data transformation pipelines, and log audit entries without human intervention. Log auditing is actively performed via Wazuh (SIEM/XDR), the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats), or other integrated AIOps observability platforms to detect degradation.
3. **End of Day (EOD) Ritual:** The agent concludes its runtime by executing privacy scans to sanitize memory, committing all verified code modifications, and securely rebasing and syncing the state back to upstream remotes.

## 4. The Cognitive IT Consultant (AIOps Role)

The DSOM framework transforms large language models into disciplined Senior ICT Consultants. The AI does not operate with unchecked autonomy; its behavior is rigorously controlled by the **Command-First Architecture**.

- **Ansible Playbook Generation:** Rather than logging directly into remote production nodes to execute ad-hoc bash commands, the AI acts as a configuration engineer. It drafts idempotent `playbooks/` that humans review and execute.
- **Procedural SOP Execution:** When tasked with operations, the AI leverages `.agents/skills/`. Through **Semantic Routing** and **Progressive Disclosure**, the AI identifies the exact standard operating procedure (e.g., `forensic-log-audit`) and strictly follows the embedded quality gates.
- **Defensive Escalation Boundaries:** The AI operates under absolute prohibition against destructive workarounds. If a critical failure occurs, the AI stops and establishes explicit "ask-first" permission boundaries, preventing catastrophic cascading failures.

---

## 5. Cognitive Security & Context Boundaries

To maintain defense-in-depth, the AI's own "mind" is secured and compartmentalized.

### The `.agents/brain/` Layer: Spatial Memory
- **`palace_registry.md`:** Replaces highly volatile, unverified conversational memory with a strict state transaction file. This blocks global context poisoning and ensures the AI's thread state is completely deterministic across server reboots or hibernation cycles.
- **Segmented Wings:** Logic is partitioned into `hall_discoveries`, `hall_events`, etc. This prevents token bleed, ensuring a compromised log from one server cannot pollute the diagnostic context of another.

### The Triple-Ledger Audit Trail
Transparency is the final layer of defense. Every configuration update, policy shift, or architectural decision must be logged symmetrically across three immutable Git-native files:
1. **`README.md`:** The surface-level map linking to core assets.
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`:** The semantic version tracker for framework evolution.
3. **`HISTORY.md`:** The universal operational ledger recording chronological interventions.

---

## Summary of System Benefits

By binding an advanced AI to a strict, Git-backed spatial memory repository, the DSOM framework systematically converts open-ended generative behavior into a disciplined, auditable enterprise engineering asset.

1. **Context Leak Prevention:** Isolating spatial memory to the `.agents/brain` directory blocks unverified global memory persistence.
2. **Flawless Orchestration:** Enforcing ASCII-only formatting guarantees clean log rendering and reliable execution across orchestration platforms.
3. **Fully Auditable Architecture:** Requiring every context shift and administrative task to execute via a dedicated Git commit creates a pristine, transparent audit trail for all AIOps adjustments.
