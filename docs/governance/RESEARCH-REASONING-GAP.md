# 🧩 The Reasoning Gap: What DSOM Solves and What It Doesn't

> *"The reasoning, the tradeoffs, the 'we tried X and it failed because Y' — all trapped in chat windows that evaporate when the session ends."*
> — MemPalace research, 2025

**Document Type:** Research Finding | **Status:** Open Gap — Partially Mitigated
**Date Identified:** 2026-04-08 | **Protocol Version:** DSOM v6.1 + Palace v1.0

## 📊 The Scale of the Problem

Six months of daily AI use produces millions of tokens of conversation. That includes every decision, every debugging session, and every architecture debate. All of it is trapped in chat windows.

> [!NOTE]
> DSOM with the Sovereign Markdown Palace addresses the **state persistence** problem effectively. This approach originated from and was inspired by the **MemPalace** research ([milla-jovovich/mempalace](https://github.com/milla-jovovich/mempalace)).

## ✅ What DSOM Solves Well

DSOM with the Sovereign Markdown Palace addresses the **cost and state persistence problem** effectively:

### State Persistence

- `task.md` — What we are working on right now (Present)
- `walkthrough.md` — Full session history with Mental Anchors (Past)
- `implementation_plan.md` — Project roadmap (Future)
- `palace_registry.md` — Spatial index loaded at every SOD

### Fact Retrieval

Each `closet.md` is a distilled, high-density summary. Instead of scanning 300+ lines of session logs, the AI walks to the relevant Room and reads a 40–80 line summary.

### Git Persistence

Every state change is committed to Git. The project state cannot be lost — it is version-controlled, multi-machine synced, and provider-agnostic.

---

## ⚠️ The Identified Gap: Live Reasoning Capture

### What the Gap Is

DSOM does **not** automatically capture the *reasoning* behind decisions. It captures outcomes — what was decided, what was built, what changed. It does not capture:

- ❌ **Why** a decision was made
- ❌ **What alternatives were considered and rejected**
- ❌ **The conversation thread** that produced the reasoning
- ❌ **"We tried X and it failed because Y"** — unless manually committed
### Why It Matters

Decisions made today become constraints six months from now. If the reasoning is lost:

- A future session may propose the same failed approach again.
- The AI has no way to explain *why* the current architecture is the way it is.
- New team members (human or AI) cannot understand the tradeoff history.

### Example Scenario

```
Session Day 1:
  Human: "Why are we using Macvlan instead of bridge networking?"
  AI: "Because Elasticsearch nodes needed their own routable IPs for
       cluster discovery. Bridge networking caused split-brain under
       load. We tested this in Phase 42 and it failed with 3 nodes."
Session Day 180 (new AI, same repo):
  Human: "Why are we using Macvlan?"
  AI: "I don't know. The config shows Macvlan but there's no reasoning
       documented. Do you want to reconsider?"
```

The outcome (Macvlan config) is in Git. The *reasoning* is gone.

## 🔧 Current Mitigation: Hibernation Notes

The existing EOD ritual includes the **Hibernation Notes export prompt**, which asks the AI to dump its full in-session memory before the session ends:

```
"List every memory you have stored about our progress and our chats of
this project... Cover: reasoning, tradeoffs, what failed and why..."
```

**Limitation:** This relies on the AI's **in-session memory at that moment**. If the session was long, context was refreshed mid-session, or the AI forgot earlier reasoning, the export is incomplete.

Hibernation Notes mitigate the gap — they do not close it.

---

## 💡 Recommended Practice: The Decision Log Protocol

### The Principle

**Capture reasoning in the moment, not at EOD.** At every significant architectural decision, constraint, or failure, immediately ask the AI to log it:

### The Command

```text
"Log this decision to walkthrough.md:
 Decision: [what] | Alternatives rejected: [what and why] | Reason: [why this]"
```

### Example

```text
"Log this decision to walkthrough.md:
 Decision: Macvlan networking for Elasticsearch nodes
 Alternatives: Bridge networking (tested Phase 42), Host networking (security risk)
 Reason: Nodes need routable IPs for cluster discovery. Bridge caused split-brain
          under 3-node load test on 2026-03-15.
 Context: Revisit if we move to Kubernetes (CNI handles this differently)."
```

This entry lands in Git **during the session**, not hours later in a summary that may lose fidelity.

### When to Trigger a Decision Log

- Any time you say "we'll use X instead of Y"
- Any time a test fails and you pivot approach
- Any time you override an AI recommendation
- Any time you establish a constraint that will affect future sessions

## 🗺️ Future Consideration: Semantic Search for DSOM

If the DSOM community grows and the reasoning backlog becomes deep, a sovereign semantic search layer could be added **without breaking the Plain Markdown Mandate**:

- Tool: `ripgrep` (already used) for keyword search across all closets
- Upgrade: A local embedding model (e.g., via Ollama) to add vector search on top of the existing Markdown files
- The Markdown files remain the source of truth — the embeddings are a search index only

This would close the gap entirely while maintaining full sovereignty and zero vendor dependency.

## 📋 Gap Status Summary

| Gap | Status | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| State persistence | ✅ Solved | `walkthrough.md` + Git |
| Fact retrieval | ✅ Solved | Walk Palace → closet.md |
| Outcome capture | ✅ Solved | Git commit history + `palace-sync` |
| **Live reasoning capture** | **⚠️ Partially mitigated** | **Hibernation Notes + Decision Log Protocol** |
| Semantic search | 🔵 Future | Planned: local Ollama embeddings |
