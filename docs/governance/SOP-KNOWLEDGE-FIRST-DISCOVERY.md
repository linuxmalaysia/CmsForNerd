# 📚 SOP: Local Knowledge-First Discovery & OKF Context Protocol

## 1. Executive Intent
To prevent unnecessary exploratory terminal commands, token window exhaustion, and context loss during agentic sessions, AI agents must adhere to the **Local Knowledge-First Protocol**. All project facts, architectural specifications, inventory mappings, and operational rules are indexed via **OKF v0.1 YAML Frontmatter** in `.agents/brain/` and `docs/`.

---

## 2. Standard Operating Procedure (5-Step Discovery Flow)

```
[ Step 1: User Request ]
         │
         ▼
[ Step 2: Local OKF Search ] ──▶ grep_search on .agents/brain/ & docs/ (topics: / description:)
         │
         ▼
[ Step 3: Local Context Inspection ] ──▶ view_file line ranges on targeted .md files
         │
         ▼
[ Step 4: Temporal Verification Gate ] ──▶ Check OKF timestamp. If old, research & prompt human for decision.
         │
         ▼
[ Step 5: Terminal Execution ] (ONLY if live runtime state or deployment change is needed)
```

### Step 1: Local Frontmatter & Metadata Search (`grep_search`)
Before issuing any exploratory terminal command (e.g. `uv run`, `powershell`, `bash`, `ansible`):
1. Search local OKF frontmatter for relevant `topics:` or `description:` keywords:
   ```bash
   grep_search Query="topics: \[ansible" SearchPath="docs/"
   ```
2. Search `.agents/brain/` checkpoint summaries and active context manifests.

### Step 2: Targeted File Viewing (`view_file`)
Once the relevant document is located via OKF frontmatter:
- Read specific line ranges using `view_file` to preserve token efficiency (Rule 10).

### Step 3: Temporal Verification Gate
The AI must check the OKF `timestamp` of the referenced document.
- If the timestamp indicates the information may be contextually outdated:
  1. The AI will optionally search external sources to find the latest standards/practices.
  2. The AI will present a comparison of the local knowledge vs. the new findings to the human operator.
  3. The human must explicitly verify whether to update the local document, create a new one, or ignore the findings before the AI proceeds.

### Step 4: Human Verification & Knowledge Update
- Based on the human's decision in Step 3, the AI will perform the necessary OKF-compliant document updates before executing any infrastructure changes.

### Step 5: Terminal Execution Gate
Terminal commands against the T1 Operator Node or T2 Control Node are authorized **ONLY** when:
- Applying code/configuration updates to production.
- Fetching live runtime data or logs that cannot be answered by local documentation.

## 3. Mandatory Rules Reference
- **Rule 6 (OKF Topics)**: All `.md` files must open on line 1 with `---` and contain `topics: [3-5 keywords]`.
- **Rule 12 (Metadata-First Discovery)**: Always query `topics:` and `description:` metadata before reading full file bodies.
- **Rule 20 (Local Knowledge-First Mandate)**: Search `.agents/brain/` and `docs/` locally before terminal execution.
- **Rule 21 (Temporal Knowledge Verification Mandate)**: Verify OKF timestamps and consult the human operator if the local knowledge is contextually outdated.
