# 🤖 AI-Assisted Development (v3.5)
Gemini + Antigravity

> **The Modern Workflow:** From "Prompt to Production"

In the modern era of backend engineering, you are no longer coding in isolation. **CMSForNerd v3.5** was architected using a high-speed synergy between **Google Gemini** (The Architect) and **Google Antigravity** (The Agent).

## 🧠 Layer 1: Google Gemini (The Architect)
Gemini acts as your strategist and theorist. Use it for:
* **Logic & Design:** Planning class hierarchies, Property Hooks, and CmsContext state.
* **RFC Compliance:** Validating your implementation against **RFC 2119** and **PSR-12**.
* **Mental Modeling:** Explaining the "Why" behind architectural choices.

## 🚀 Layer 2: Google Antigravity (The Agent)
Antigravity is the executioner. It handles the physical operations:
* **File Operations:** Writing `.php` controllers and `.inc` fragments to disk.
* **Terminal Control:** Running `composer compliance` and `phpunit`.
* **Git Mastery:** Handling staging and commits once code is verified.

## 📜 Layer 3: The Master Protocol (The Handshake)
The **[AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md](AI-MASTER-PROTOCOL.md)** is the binding "Constitution" between the Architect and the Agent. It prevents context decay and ensures that every AI session is a continuation of the last, rather than a restart.

* **Intelligence Audit**: All agents MUST perform the "Morning Ritual" (Sync Chain) before modifying code.
* **State Persistence**: Agents are responsible for updating `.agent/brain/` artifacts to preserve the project's "State of Mind."
* **Zero-Error Handoff**: No session is complete until the **Wrap-up Protocol** is executed and verified.

## 🌐 The "Triple Threat" Discovery Strategy
To ensure AI search engines (like Perplexity or ChatGPT) accurately categorize your CMS content, we use three layers:

1.  **Microdata (Immediate):** HTML attributes for instant tag-based classification.
2.  **JSON-LD (Detailed):** Structured scripting for Google Search Rich Cards.
3.  **RDF (Formal):** Dublin Core standards for semantic web relationships.

## ⚖️ The "Good AI Citizen" Rules
* **MUST:** Verify `declare(strict_types=1);` exists on every AI-generated file.
* **MUST NOT:** Bypass `composer compliance`. If the AI writes code that fails the audit, it IS REJECTED.
* **SHOULD:** Ask Gemini to generate a Unit Test for every new logic block it writes.
