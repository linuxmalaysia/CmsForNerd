# 🤖 AI-Assisted Development: Gemini + Antigravity

> **The Modern Workflow:** From "Prompt to Production"

In the modern era of backend development, you are no longer coding alone. **CMSForNerd v3.3** uses a high-speed synergy between **Google Gemini** (The Architect) and **Google Antigravity** (The Agent).

---

## 🧠 Layer 1: Google Gemini (The Architect)
Gemini acts as your strategist. You use it for:
* **Logic Planning:** Designing class hierarchies and property hooks.
* **RFC Compliance:** Checking if your code adheres to **RFC 2119**.
* **Audit Analysis:** Paste an error, and Gemini finds the root cause.

## 🚀 Layer 2: Google Antigravity (The Agent)
Antigravity is the executioner. It handles:
* **File I/O:** Writing the `.php` and `.inc` files to your site.
* **Compliance:** Running `./vendor/bin/phpcs` and `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.
* **Deployment:** Staging and pushing code to GitHub once verified.
## 🌐 The "Triple Threat" Discovery Strategy
To ensure AI search engines (like Perplexity or ChatGPT) understand your content, CMSForNerd uses three layers:

1.  **Microdata (Immediate):** HTML attributes for instant classification.
2.  **JSON-LD (Detailed):** Structured data for Google Search Rich Cards.
3.  **RDF (Formal):** Dublin Core standards for semantic web relationships.

**Student Tip:** You can override a page's identity in the entry point:
```php
$CONTENT['schemaType'] = 'SoftwareApplication';
$CONTENT['lang'] = 'ms'; // For Malay content
```
##⚖️ AI Ethics & Rules

    MUST: Ask the AI to verify strict_types=1 on every new file.

    MUST NOT: Bypass composer compliance. If the AI writes code that fails the audit, the code is rejected.

    SHOULD: Ask Gemini why a specific pattern was used to learn the theory behind the code.
