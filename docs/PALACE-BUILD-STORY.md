# 🏛️ PALACE-BUILD-STORY: How the Sovereign Markdown Palace Was Built

> *"Sovereignty through Spatial Awareness. Recall through Structured Reflection."*
> — DSOM Palace Protocol v1.0

**Version:** v1.0 | **Date:** 2026-04-08 | **Tag:** `v10.0.0-palace`

---

## 1. 🧩 The Problem We Were Solving

Before the Palace, the DSOM brain had a **flat file problem**.

The AI's memory was stored in a single, growing `walkthrough.md` file. As sessions accumulated over months, this file grew to hundreds of lines. The AI was forced to scan the entire document to find relevant context — causing:

- **Context Decay:** The AI would miss older architectural decisions buried deep in the log.
- **Attention Drift:** With 300+ lines loaded, the AI's effective recall of early context dropped sharply.
- **Linear Retrieval:** There was no way to jump directly to "what do we know about Ansible" — you had to read everything.

The `task.md`, `walkthrough.md`, and `implementation_plan.md` structure (the "Drawer") was excellent for *persistence*, but weak for *retrieval*.

---

## 2. 💡 The Inspiration: MemPalace

The solution came from the [MemPalace](https://github.com/andrewyng/mempalace) concept — inspired by the ancient **Method of Loci** technique where Greek orators memorised entire speeches by mentally placing ideas in rooms of an imaginary building.

The DSOM adaptation: **store everything in Git (the Drawer), then organise it spatially (the Palace).**

- The Drawer (`walkthrough.md`) = **temporal** (time-ordered, verbatim, persistent)
- The Palace (`wings/`) = **semantic** (meaning-ordered, distilled, fast retrieval)

Neither replaces the other. They work in tandem — **Dual-Mode Persistence**.

---

## 3. 🏗️ The Architecture We Designed

The Palace is a 5-layer directory hierarchy inside `.agents/brain/`:

```
.agents/brain/wings/
└── wing_dsom_core/               # Wing (Domain)
    ├── hall_facts/               # Hall (Memory Type: Immutable Laws)
    │   ├── room_clean_architecture/closet.md
    │   ├── room_crisp_strategy/closet.md
    │   ├── room_dsom_protocol/closet.md
    │   └── room_tooling/closet.md
    ├── hall_events/              # Hall (Memory Type: Chronological Milestones)
    │   ├── room_sovereign_fabric_v9_8/closet.md
    │   ├── room_brain_artifacts/closet.md
    │   └── room_ledger/closet.md
    └── hall_discoveries/         # Hall (Memory Type: Breakthroughs & Misc)
        └── room_uncategorised/closet.md
```

Each `closet.md` is a **distilled, high-density knowledge summary** — what the AI actually needs to know, without reading 300 lines of raw session logs.

## 4. 🛠️ The Tools We Built

### `palace-sync.sh` / `palace-sync.ps1` (v1.0) — The Bridge

The core automation tool. It reads the git commit history and maps every commit to the correct Palace Room based on the file path changed.

**Two modes:**

- **EOD Batch:** Reads commits since the last sync marker. Generates a lean `palace_update_proposal_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **`--backfill`:** Reads the ENTIRE git history from Day 0. Generates a comprehensive Palace population proposal covering all historical commits.

**Path-to-Room mapping logic:**

| File Pattern | Target Room |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | `hall_facts/room_dsom_protocol` |
| `tools/` | `hall_facts/room_tooling` |
| `playbooks/`, `roles/`, `inventory/` | `hall_events/room_sovereign_fabric` |
| `.agents/brain/` | `hall_events/room_brain_artifacts` |
| `CHANGELOG.md`, `HISTORY.md` | `hall_events/room_ledger` |
| `README.md`, `SUMMARY.md` | `hall_facts/room_dsom_protocol` |

### `hibernation.sh` / `hibernation.ps1` (upgraded to v2.1)

Added **Step 7: Palace Spatial Reflection** — automatically runs `palace-sync` before the Sovereign Save, ensuring the Brain never lags behind the code.

### `reanimate.sh` / `reanimate.ps1` (upgraded to v2.2/v2.1)

Added **Section [14]: Palace Registry** — the SOD manifest now includes the full Palace Registry, giving the AI instant spatial awareness on every session start without needing to ask.

## 6. ✅ The Result

The Sovereign Markdown Palace v1.0 is a **living, sovereign, version-controlled, AI-readable spatial memory system** that:

1. Requires **zero proprietary infrastructure** — just plain Markdown files in Git.
2. **Backtracks years of history** in minutes using `palace-sync --backfill`.
3. **Automatically updates** every EOD via `hibernation.sh`.
4. **Loads instantly** at SOD via Section [14] of the reanimation manifest.
5. Follows the **Plain Markdown Mandate** — human-legible, AI-indexable, Git-versioned.
