# 🎭 Persona Injector

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when a user says "I want to inject my persona", "make the AI act like me", or "setup my identity matrix".

## Instructions
1. **Fetch Template:** Read the `docs/agent-configs/SOVEREIGN-PERSONA-TEMPLATE.md` file using your file reading tools.
2. **Interview User:** Present the categories from the template to the user (e.g., Identity, Core Profile, Writing Style, Architectural Principles). Ask them to provide their specifics either all at once or step-by-step.
3. **Format Matrix:** Once the user has provided their details, format the data exactly as defined in the `<RULE[PERSONA.md]>` OKF block from the template.
4. **Inject Rule:** Use your file editing tools to append this formatted block to the bottom of `.agents/AGENTS.md`.
5. **Verify:** Confirm to the user that the AI operating in this workspace has now permanently inherited their identity, constraints, and linguistic DNA.
