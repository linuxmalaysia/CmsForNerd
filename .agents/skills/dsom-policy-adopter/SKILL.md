# DSOM Policy Adopter Skill

**Purpose**: To seamlessly ingest external architectural or governance documents and integrate them into the DSOM repository strictly adhering to the Triple-Ledger Synchronization Mandate and Core Rules.

## Prerequisites
- The user has provided an absolute path to a document (e.g., PDF or Markdown).
- If the document is a PDF, the AI should use the `pdf-text-extractor` tool to read the contents first.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Ingest & Extract**
   - Read the provided document in its entirety.
   - Extract the core architectural principles, rules, and actionable constraints that apply to the DSOM ecosystem.
   - **Contextual Tailoring**: Actively filter and modify the extracted constraints to fit the specific architecture of the current project (e.g., mapping remote execution steps to local T1 Windows / T2 WSL2 node configurations, removing irrelevant technology references).

2. **Draft Governance Document**
   - Create a dedicated, highly-structured Markdown file in the docs/governance/ directory.
   - The file must contain OKF v0.1 YAML frontmatter (with okf_version, type: documentation, title, and timestamp).
   - Format the document strictly following the Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) standard: Authoritative tone, verifiable statistics/quotes, H2 user-centric headings, and 200-400 word chunks.

3. **Core Engine Injection (AGENTS.md)**
   - Distill the most critical, actionable constraints from the new policy.
   - Inject these constraints directly as a new numbered Core Rule into .agents/AGENTS.md. Be extremely precise; do not bloat the file.

4. **Dual Documentation Sync & Signature**
   - **Rule 13 (Signature)**: Inject the standard DSOM ownership, timestamp, and GPL v3.0 license signature at the bottom of the new document.
   - **Rule 14 (Dual Sync)**: Explicitly map the new governance document into BOTH `SUMMARY.md` and `mkdocs.yml` under the appropriate category to prevent orphaned documentation.

5. **Triple-Ledger Synchronization**
   - **README.md**: Add a link to the new `docs/governance/` file in the "Key Documents" table with a short emoji-prefixed description.
   - **CHANGELOG.md**: Add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` describing the new governance policy and rule addition.
   - **HISTORY.md**: Append a new entry to the universal ledger detailing the architectural integration and the exact files modified.

6. **Defensive GitOps (Commit & Push)**
   - Run `git pull --rebase origin main` to ensure sync.
   - Add all changed files: `git add docs/governance/... .agents/AGENTS.md README.md CHANGELOG.md HISTORY.md SUMMARY.md mkdocs.yml`
   - Commit with an atomic, conventional commit message (e.g., `docs(governance): adopt [Policy Name]`).
   - Push to all active remotes (e.g., GitHub and GitLab).

7. **Closure & Walkthrough**
   - Report the successful adoption to the user, highlighting the exact architectural changes made.
