# DSOM Signature Injector

**Purpose**: To enforce digital sovereignty and authorship across all readable files in the DSOM framework.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Trigger Condition**: When generating a new Markdown file, script, or playbook, or when the user asks to sign/stamp a directory or file.
2. **Execute Script**: Run the embedded Python script targeting the specific file or directory.

   ```bash
   python .agents/skills/dsom-signature-injector/scripts/inject.py <target_path>
   ```

## Technical Constraints
- **Markdown (.md):** The script blind-appends the signature to the bottom using an italicized Markdown footer. The timestamp is dynamically calculated from the file's \mtime\.
- **Code Files (.sh, .ps1, .yml):** The script prepends the signature to the top of the file using the appropriate comment syntax (e.g., \#\) to ensure the code remains executable without fatal syntax errors.
