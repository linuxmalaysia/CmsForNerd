# 🕵️ Palace Auditor Skill

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user requests a workspace audit, health check, or when preparing for a major structural release to ensure the `.agents` palace is pristine.

## Instructions
1. **Diagnostic Check:** Run `.\tools\diagnostic.ps1` (or `./tools/diagnostic.sh` on Linux) and capture the output. Ensure all dependencies (`uv`, `node`, `git`) and paths are healthy.
2. **Index Verification:** Read `.agents/brain/index.md`. Verify that every `closet.md` or `.md` file listed under `Path:` actually exists in the filesystem.
3. **Toolchain Audit:**
   - List all files in the `tools/` directory.
   - List all documentation files in `docs/tools/`.
   - Identify any `.ps1`, `.sh`, `.py`, or `.js` script in `tools/` that does NOT have a corresponding structural blueprint in `docs/tools/`.
   - Identify any script that lacks either its `.ps1` or `.sh` cross-platform twin.
4. **Report Generation:** Create a report artifact for the user summarizing:
   - System Diagnostic Health.
   - Broken links in `index.md` (if any).
   - Undocumented scripts.
   - Scripts violating the Cross-Platform Mandate.
5. **Propose Actions:** Suggest specific actions to resolve the findings.
