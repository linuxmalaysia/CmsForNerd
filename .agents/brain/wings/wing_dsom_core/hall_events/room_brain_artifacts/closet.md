# 🚪 Closet: Room Brain Artifacts (The Living Memory)

This closet tracks the evolution of the `.agents/brain/` directory — the AI's persistent working memory store.

## 🧠 Brain Directory Structure

```
.agents/brain/
├── task.md              # Current task list (active cutting edge)
├── walkthrough.md       # Chronological session log (The Drawer)
├── implementation_plan.md  # Technical roadmap
├── palace_registry.md   # Spatial retrieval map (Palace entry point)
├── wings/               # Spatial Palace hierarchy
│   └── wing_dsom_core/
│       ├── hall_facts/
│       └── hall_events/
├── hibernation-notes-YYYY-MM-DD.txt  # EOD auto-generated notes
└── palace_update_proposal_*.md       # Git→Palace mapping proposals
```

## 📅 Evolution Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| `2026-01-07` | `task.md` initialised. First DSOM context scaffold. |
| `2026-01-08` | `walkthrough.md` created. First Mental Anchor set. `implementation_plan.md` + `DSOM_TEMPLATE.md` added. |
| `2026-01-11` | New notebook onboarded. Brain portable and resumed on new device (proof of portability). |
| `2026-01-12` | Sunday Audit ritual formalised. Clean Architecture formalised in `walkthrough.md`. |
| `2026-01-16` | Windows Platform Support phase. `implementation_plan.md` updated. All brain files fully tracked in Git. |
| `2026-01-23` | `HISTORY.md` sync ritual formalised. Universal ledger initialised. |
| `2026-01-27–31` | Member brain under `.agents/brain/member/haris/`. Polyglot governance, ITIL 4, Mirror of Knowledge. |
| `2026-03-10` | Brain re-scoped back to baseline template. Logstash/Kafka context removed. |
| `2026-03-24` | v6.1.0 session. `hibernation-notes-2026-03-24.txt` created. Ansible baseline wiring. |
| `2026-04-05` | v6.2.1 EOD save. Ansible common role completeed. Brain fully synced. |
| `2026-04-08` | **Palace v1.0 launched.** Palace Registry, Wings, Halls, Rooms, Closets — all created and pushed. |
| `2026-04-08` | **v10.0.0 Encyclopedia.** 18 HOWTO guides released and integrated into the Palace. |
| `2026-04-08` | **Documentation Refinement.** Purged premature cost data; credited **MemPalace** origination ([Proposal: 2250](file:///d:/Users/LinuxMalaysia/Projects/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai/.agents/brain/palace_update_proposal_2026-04-08_2250.md)). |

## 🔑 Key Design Principles

- **Atomic Updates:** Brain files are updated at every session boundary (SOD/EOD).
- **Never Blind Add:** `hibernation.sh` selectively stages brain files only.
- **Date-Anchored:** Every `walkthrough.md` session entry must include today's date as a searchable anchor.
- **Dual Persistence:** `walkthrough.md` (Drawer) + `wings/` (Palace) operate in tandem.

## 🔗 Retrieval Reference

- **Primary Drawer:** [walkthrough.md](file:///d:/Users/LinuxMalaysia/Projects/deep-state-of-mind-for-my-ai/.agents/brain/walkthrough.md)
