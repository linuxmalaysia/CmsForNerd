# 🚪 Closet: Room Jules Knowledge (The Cognitive Database)

This closet serves as the sovereign persistent memory database for the AI Cognitive Twin (Jules), containing all 52 pieces of project knowledge, guidelines, and constraints.

---

## 🏛️ Verbatim Knowledge Database

1. **Docker Validation Test Exposing Port:** The repository's Docker validation tests require Dockerfile and Containerfile to expose port 80 (even if also exposing other ports), restrict chown permissions specifically to /var/www/html/data for defense in depth, avoid duplicate entries/comments in .dockerignore, and maintain identical exclusion configurations between sonar-project.properties and GHA workflows.

2. **Apache .htaccess Match Restrictions:** In Apache configurations, using <DirectoryMatch> or <Directory> tags inside .htaccess files is forbidden and causes 500 Internal Server Errors on deployment. Access restrictions within .htaccess should instead be implemented using mod_rewrite rules (e.g., RewriteRule) wrapped in <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>.

3. **Co-existing Manifests:** The repository maintains co-existing Dockerfile and Containerfile configurations at the repository root. Containerfile is preferred for native Podman 5+ workflows, while Dockerfile is a duplicate copy maintained for cloud-based Docker and Render deployments to resolve build engine limitations (e.g., open Dockerfile: no such file or directory errors).

4. **Render Blueprint Deployments:** The repository supports Render Blueprint deployments using render.yaml configured for the singapore region, explicitly pointing to a root-level Dockerfile (which co-exists as a duplicate of Containerfile to guarantee standard Docker/Render build engine compatibility) targeting PHP 8.4 and Apache (with mod_rewrite, mod_headers, and .htaccess overrides enabled).

5. **Podman 5 Preference:** The repository completely favors Podman version 5 and above, standardizing all configuration templates by migrating from Docker names to native Podman specifications (renaming Dockerfile to Containerfile and docker-compose.yml to compose.yml). To guarantee compatibility with cloud-based Docker/Render deployments, a duplicate root-level Dockerfile co-exists.

6. **Render Timezone & Secret Handling:** Render Blueprint configurations utilize the TZ environment variable set to Asia/Kuala_Lumpur to adjust timezones, and enforce credential security by using sync: false for APP_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD to avoid committing raw secrets to Git/GitHub.

7. **Rule 14 Navigation Mapping:** In compliance with Rule 14 (Omni-Documentation Sync), newly created technical documentation is systematically registered in four distinct navigation maps: SUMMARY.md (GitBook), mkdocs.yml (MkDocs), START-HERE.md (Sovereign Onboarding), and llms.txt (External AI Indexing).

8. **Semantic LLM Crawlability:** The project implements the modern /llms.txt and .llms/index.md standards for semantic LLM crawlability, mapping architectural specifications, file directories, and security rules clearly for cognitive agents.

9. **Master Onboarding Gateway:** The project exposes an onboarding entry map at START-HERE.md at the repository root, detailing 12 distinct Entry Points spanning setup guidelines, coding rules, deployment orchestration, and core architecture mapping.

10. **Dynamic OpenSCAP Auditing:** The setup_os role integrates dynamic, OS-aware (Ubuntu 24.04 vs RHEL/AlmaLinux 9/10) OpenSCAP auditing and automatic security hardening by unzipping the latest SCAP guides, scanning under a CIS Level 2 Profile, running OVAL scans, executing remediations, and compiling combined Lynis & OpenSCAP scores into a security compliance report (SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md).

11. **Sovereign Node Bootstrapping:** The repository includes an initial node bootstrapping and OS baseline setup playbook (playbooks/bootstrap_node.yml) and dedicated Ansible role (playbooks/roles/setup_os/) to configure a clean host for running cmsfornerd on Podman 5, targeting 'localhost' with playbooks and utilizing sanitised private IP addresses (e.g. 10.0.0.10) inside inventory files (e.g. inventory/hosts.example.yml).

12. **Procedural Agent Skills Limits:** Procedural AI agent skills reside in .agents/skills/ (using OKF SKILL.md files) and are constrained to a strict 4,000-token limit per section, verified by .agents/skills/dsom-token-calculator/scripts/calculate-tokens.pyexport. All newly created files must be properly registered under spatial memories.

13. **Rule 24 End of Day Memory Consolidation:** Rule 24 is defined in .agents/AGENTS.md (and documented in AGENTS.md), instructing the AI agent (Jules) to review past memories, git log, and active task details to record all completed work within .agents/brain/task.md and .agents/brain/walkthrough.md at the end of every operational session, finishing with EOD rituals and git status verification.

14. **Google Jules VM Sessions:** Google Jules VM session environments run as Google Cloud Workstations and can be configured to permanently deploy Ubuntu 26.04+ and Podman 5+ by updating the Workstation configuration template to target supported predefined images (such as code-oss) or custom Ubuntu 26.04 container images.

15. **Playbook Assertions:** The Ansible playbooks enforce the Podman 5+ contract via assertions on the parsed major version after running 'podman --version' and restrict package installation to Ubuntu 24.04+ (or when explicitly configured with 'podman_5_setup_equivalent').

16. **CMS Minimum Requirements:** CmsForNerd is a flat-file PHP laboratory CMS that requires PHP 8.3+.

17. **BunkerWeb SSL/TLS Termination:** BunkerWeb is configured in production (playbooks/roles/podman_prod/templates/compose.yml.j2) to terminate SSL/TLS directly using native self-signed certificate generation (GENERATE_SELF_SIGNED_SSL=yes and LISTEN_HTTPS=yes on port 8443) with host port 443 mapped to 8443.

18. **Grep Commands in Bash Scrutiny:** In bash validation scripts run under set -e, executing grep -c directly inside a command substitution triggers failure branches on zero matches because it exits with status 1; guarding with || true or standardizing to grep | wc -l is used to safely capture counts as an integer expression.

19. **Rootless Port Terminators:** The repository supports rootless container deployment orchestration using Ansible and Podman (detailed in ANSIBLE_PODMAN_GUIDE.md). In production, instead of using global host-wide unprivileged port-binding sysctl configuration, the stack enforces a dedicated-host invariant where privileged port access (80/443) is terminated by a dedicated front-end proxy or bound via narrow system capabilities.

20. **Audit Pre-flight Gateway:** The ./tools/audit-pre-flight.sh check serves as a hybrid gateway, verifying the local PHP 8.3+ requirement (checking PHP_VERSION_ID >= 80300) using Bash [[ ]] expressions, alongside DSOM state-of-mind and git synchronization, and supports bypass via the BYPASS_PHP_CHECK=1 environment variable.

21. **Container State-based checks:** The podman_prod role determines deployment changes for the container stack using state-based conditions derived from the running states of all expected containers (e.g. checking if they are all 'running' and that all expected services are present) rather than relying on podman-compose up stdout/stderr status text.

22. **Deploy Validation Wrapper:** The deployment wrapper tools/deploy-prod.sh validates unprivileged identity constraints (dsom-admin:2001:2001) by calling a standalone validation script tools/validate-inventory.py which loads inventory variables (falling back to regex parsing of inventory/hosts.prod.yml if ansible-inventory fails), supports Ansible @file inputs, and fails on conflicting overrides. Sudo Lock play-level become constraints are validated with a broadened grep count (grep -c) that captures truthy case variants of true, yes, and on safely under set -e.

23. **Blocked Git Pull Command:** The execution sandbox environment blocks shell scripts containing the literal command 'git pull'. Code synchronization must be performed using 'git fetch' followed by 'git merge' instead.

24. **Primary Targeted OS:** Ubuntu 26.04 (Resolute Raccoon) is the primary targeted deployment OS because it is the first stable release to offer native, out-of-the-box package support for stable Podman 5.x without requiring unstable external PPAs.

25. **Active Task Tracking:** Project tasks, modules, and implementation states are actively managed and tracked within .agents/brain/task.md.

26. **Spatial Memory Framework:** The project maintains spatial memory via a Sovereign Markdown Palace Registry (.agents/brain/palace_registry.md) and manages context window loads using .agents/brain/active_context_manifest.md.

27. **Shallow Clone Fetching:** The development environment's Git repository is checked out as a shallow clone by default. Before performing branch merges or operations requiring full history, run git fetch --unshallow to restore the complete commit history and avoid 'unrelated histories' errors.

28. **Become Sudo Lock Boundaries:** Playbook play-level privilege escalation (become: true) is disabled in deploy_prod_compose.yml to enforce Sudo Lock boundaries, scoping root become requirements explicitly to host-foundation tasks or role invocations, while container deployment tasks run in unprivileged user-space.

29. **Nginx Hidden Dotfile Security:** The Nginx configuration template contains rules blocking access to all hidden dotfiles (including .env, .user.ini, and .htaccess) before generic path routing, while preserving /.well-known ACME challenge paths.

30. **Ansible Playbook Minimum OS Checks:** The Ansible playbooks enforce strict distribution-appropriate minimum OS versions during pre-flight checks: Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13+, and RedHat-family 9+ (such as AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, or Oracle Linux).

31. **Rootless Podman 5 system packages:** To satisfy rootless container execution requirements in Podman 5, playbooks ensure critical system packages are installed on Debian/Ubuntu targets, including uidmap (subuid/subgid mapping), dbus-user-session (systemd user communication), and catatonit (signal forwarding init process), and command execution uses loginctl enable-linger to guarantee container persistence after user logout.

32. **Google Jules Agent Setup Docs:** The Google Jules agent setup and environment prerequisites are documented comprehensively inside docs/HOWTO-SETUP-GOOGLE-JULES-UBUNTU-26-04.md, showcasing unprivileged namespaces, lingering, and Podman-compatible tool suites.

33. **Markdown Line-Length Limit:** Markdown files in the repository are configured with a 140-character line length limit inside .markdownlint.json, but walkthrough.md and active constraints specify a target of 120-character line-length limit in documentation.

34. **XSS and Host Header Protections:** To prevent Host Header injection, XML/HTML-based XSS, and SonarCloud code duplication across sitemap and feed generators, $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] detection is centralized in SecurityUtils::getSafeBaseUrl(), which validates incoming hosts against an explicit allowlist (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, cmsfornerd.test) and returns 400 Bad Request for untrusted headers. The scanning logic is centralized in SecurityUtils::discoverPages(), and dynamic XML/HTML outputs must be escaped using SecurityUtils::escapeHtml().

35. **Rigid CSP Directives:** The application enforces a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) where inline event handlers are blocked, inline scripts require a nonce, and sitemap outputs (sitemap.php) enforce a restrictive style-src 'none' directive.

36. **Centralized Page Resolution Helper:** Routing and security resolution checks for pages are centralized within the SecurityUtils::resolvePageName() helper method, which accepts an optional fallback page name parameter (such as passing 'graduation' in graduation.php to prevent query-parameter-based fallback routing back to 'index').

37. **EOD and Release Rituals:** The End-of-Day (EOD) and release rituals are defined under .agents/skills/eod-palace-sync/ and .agents/skills/dsom-release-manager/; they require maintaining .agents/brain/checkpoint_summary.txt (the [DSOM EPISODIC RECORD]), appending to .agents/brain/walkthrough.md, updating CHANGELOG.md, promoting ledgers like docs/HISTORY.md and .agents/brain/wings/wing_dsom_core/hall_events/room_ledger/closet.md, and saving scratch release notes under .agents/brain/scratch/release_notes.txt. Note that any edits to walkthrough.md, releases notes, or history.md should have their signatures injected as well.

38. **Security Boundary Testing:** The codebase verifies dynamic output security defenses (directory traversal boundaries, bot spoofing detection, and IPv6 range boundaries) via automated unit tests inside tests/SecurityTest.php, and details Dynamic XSS/Host Header protections inside docs/xss-protection-guide.md.

39. **Adaptive CSS Custom Properties:** The codebase uses adaptive semantic CSS custom properties (e.g., --lab-section-bg, --lab-box-bg, --lab-alert-bg, --lab-warning-bg, --lab-code-bg) in themes/CmsForNerd/style.css and high-specificity rules prefixed with #content to safely override hardcoded/inline light-theme backgrounds and ensure correct Dark Mode contrast globally.

40. **Dual AGENTS.md rule:** AI agent rules are governed by a dual AGENTS.md architecture (Root Gateway Mandate): a root-level gateway AGENTS.md (summarising the DSOM protocol, the 3-step Mechanical Boot Sequence, the 5-step Knowledge-First Discovery Flow, and directing agents to .agents/AGENTS.md and .agents/brain/) and the full sovereign constitution rulebook at .agents/AGENTS.md. Both files must carry current OKF timestamp values and be kept synchronised whenever updated.

41. **Curl Insecure Flag Block:** When using curl inside repository scripts, avoid using -k or --insecure flags to bypass SSL/TLS validation as this is flagged as a high-severity security vulnerability by SonarCloud scans. When dynamically running npm tools like markdownlint-cli in a GHA workflow, ensure node_modules/ is added to .markdownlintignore to prevent scanning external dependencies.

42. **SonarCloud and Workflow Hardening:** To resolve common repository security scanning findings: limit GHA workspace default access using top-level or job-level restricted permissions; secure dynamic script package execution using pinned dependency versions with --ignore-scripts (e.g. npm) or --only-binary=:all: (e.g. pip); restrict redirected curl protocols to secure endpoints using --proto-redir =https and wget using --https-only; and configure sonar-project.properties exclusions (like tests/**) to prevent false positive static analysis flags on unit test files.

43. **Signature Injector Integration:** All readable scripts, playbooks, and configuration YAML files edited or generated should be processed using uv run .agents/skills/dsom-signature-injector/scripts/inject.py <target> to prepend DSOM digital sovereignty and author signature headers while ensuring no duplicate headers are introduced.

44. **Production Deployment Stack:** The production environment uses Ansible and Podman-Compose (playbooks/deploy_prod_compose.yml and dsom_prod role) to deploy a hardened, rootless multi-layered web stack (BunkerWeb, Nginx, PHP-FPM 8.5) under the unprivileged dsom-admin:2001:2001 identity.

45. **Production Deployment Layout:** The production deployment directory layout is anchored at /opt/cmsfornerd/ with subdirectories for settings/data (bunkerweb/, nginx/, php-fpm/) and code (codes/), with user-level systemd lingering for high availability and automated restart of rootless containers.

46. **Production Deployment Wrapper:** The production deployment lifecycle is controlled by the tools/deploy-prod.sh wrapper script, enforcing the 'Trinity of Safety' (Status Probe, Sovereign Gate, Sudo Lock) and executing syntax/validity validations.

47. **Sovereign Workspace Architecture:** The repository uses the Deep State of Mind (DSOM) Protocol, which structures the AI agent's workspace under the plural .agents/ directory.

48. **Composer Installation PHP Constraints:** If the development sandbox environment is running PHP 8.3, dependencies must be installed using composer install --ignore-platform-reqs to bypass the PHP 8.4 requirement constraint.

49. **Dual-View Standard/AMP Rendering:** The application supports Dual-View rendering (Standard with hybrid-SPA AJAX routing and AMP via ?view=amp) controlled by themes/CmsForNerd/pager.php.

50. **Zero-Global Code Architecture:** The codebase implements a 'Zero-Global' architecture where the 'global' keyword and '$GLOBALS' are prohibited, using \CmsForNerd\Registry and CmsContext for state management instead.

51. **DevOps QA and Testing Verification:** DevOps verification and quality checks are run using composer lab-check (which runs PHPStan Level 8 static analysis, code standard audits, and Pest PHP tests via composer test).

52. **Local Server Execution:** The local development server should be executed using php -S 0.0.0.0:3000 to run on port 3000.
