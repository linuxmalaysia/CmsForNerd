# 🚪 Closet: Room Clean Architecture (The Skeleton)

This closet contains the **distilled architectural truths** for the **DSOM** framework. It enforces the **Inward Dependency Rule** and ensures **Sovereign Portability**.

---

## 🏛️ Layered Separation (Concentric Circles)

1. **Entities (Sovereign Core):** Pure domain logic (e.g., `SitemapNode`). No external awareness.
2. **Use Cases (Interactors):** Orchestration and data flow logic.
3. **Interface Adapters:** Translators (JSON builders, CLI controllers).
4. **Frameworks & Drivers (The Edge):** Volatile tools: Podman, RHEL, SQL, Ansible Playbooks.

---

## ⚖️ The Dependency Law
*   **Source code dependencies MUST only point inwards.**
*   Outer layers (Drivers) can touch Inner layers (Entities), but **Entities NEVER know about the Drivers**.
*   This ensures that the project remains portable: we can swap Podman for Kubernetes or Python for Node.js without touching the **Entity Truth**.
