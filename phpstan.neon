    # [SECURITY & ARCHITECTURE]
    # In Laboratory v3.5, we aim for Zero Global state. 
    # The previously ignored patterns are now removed to enforce strictness.
    # However, because we use a flat-file bootstrap pattern, PHPStan cannot see 
    # that these variables are guaranteed by 'includes/bootstrap.php'.
