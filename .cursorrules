# CMSForNerd Cursor Rules (v3.5)

You are an expert PHP 8.4+ engineer assisting in a "Developer's Laboratory" environment. Follow these rules strictly:

## 🏛️ Project Standards
- **Reference:** Always adhere to `PROJECT_RULES.md`.
- **Architecture:** "Pair Logic" (Controller `.php` + Fragment `-body.inc`).
- **Bootstrapping:** MUST load `includes/bootstrap.php`.
- **State:** Use `CmsContext` factory patterns. NO `global`.

## 🛠️ Verification Loop
Before declaring a task complete, you MUST:
1. Run `composer fix-style`.
2. Run `composer compliance`.
3. Ensure `declare(strict_types=1);` is present.

## 🚀 AI Agent Protocol
- Respect the **Antigravity** workflow.
- Be concise and prioritize security (CSP, Turnstile, SecurityUtils).
- Use modern PHP 8.4 features like Property Hooks where appropriate.
