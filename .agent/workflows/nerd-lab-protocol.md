# 🧪 The Nerd Lab Protocol (v3.5)

This workflow defines the "State of Mind" and sequence of operations required to maintain the CMSForNerd Laboratory. Follow these steps every time you resume work or collaborate with other developers/agents.

## 1. Intelligence Audit (The "State of Mind")
// turbo
1. Read `docs/AI-STATE-SYNC.md` to understand the current architectural milestone.
2. Review the latest `git log -n 10` and `HISTORY.md` to track recent granular commits.
3. Consult `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` in the `.agent/brain/` directory for persistent context.

## 2. Structural Synchronization
1. **Baseline Check:** Ensure `index.php` and `template.php` are logically identical. They are the "Single Source of Truth."
2. **Controller Sync:** Verify all `.php` page controllers reflect the current version and security headers.
3. **Theme/CSS Check:** Audit `:root` variables in `themes/CmsForNerd/style.css` and ensures `theme.php` versioning matches the core.

## 3. The "Pair Logic" Audit
1. Verify that every `.php` controller has a corresponding `contents/*-body.inc` fragment.
2. Ensure `includes/sitemap_generator.php` correctly discovers these pairs.
3. Sync SEO protocols: `sitemap.php`, `rss.php`, `ror.php`, `robots.txt`, and `labels.rdf`.

## 4. Documentation & Educational Integrity
1. **GitBook Sync:** Every logical change in `contents/` MUST be reflected in the `docs/` markdown files.
2. **"The Why" Comments:** code MUST include "Laboratory-style" comments explaining PHP 8.4 patterns for educational purposes.

## 5. Agentic Verification
1. Run `composer fix-style` (PSR-12).
2. Run `composer compliance` (PHPUnit + PHPStan Level 8).
3. Ensure `declare(strict_types=1);` is present on all files.

## 6. Deployment & History
1. Perform **Granular Commits** (one file at a time or by logical group).
2. Use descriptive messages (e.g., `feat(seo): sync rss.php with pair logic`).
3. Update `walkthrough.md` to record the "State of Mind" for the next session.
