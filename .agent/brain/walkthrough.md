# 🏁 Walkthrough: Mobile Mastery & State of Mind (v3.5.0)

I have completed the integration of the **AMP Dual-View Engine** and the formalization of the **"State of Mind" (SoM) Protocol**. This milestone moves CMSForNerd from a desktop-centric laboratory to a high-performance, mobile-validated environment with a robust human-AI synchronization workflow.

## 🚀 Key Accomplishments (v3.5.0 Update)

### 1. Dual-View Architecture (AMP Integration)

---

* **The Router**: Rebuilt `themes/CmsForNerd/pager.php` as a decision engine. It now detects `?view=amp` and routes the request through a specialized mobile pipeline while reusing the same `-body.inc` content fragments.
* **Fragment Transformation**: Implemented an Output Buffer (OB) processor that dynamically swaps `<img>` tags for `<amp-img layout="responsive">` tags, satisfying strict AMP validation without manual content duplication.
* **The Interactive Sidebar**: Created `themes/CmsForNerd/amp-sidebar.tpl`. This provides a zero-JavaScript mobile navigation experience using the `amp-sidebar` component, featuring active-page highlighting.

### 2. Defensive Front-End Guardrails

* **CSS Size Guard**: Integrated a file-size validator in `nav-helper.inc.php`. It monitors `amp.css` and injects an HTML warning if the code exceeds the strict 75KB AMP limit.
* **CSP Nonce Propagation**: Hardened the security layer to ensure that the `amp-sidebar` script and the core AMP library are explicitly authorized via cryptographic nonces, preventing XSS even in mobile view.
* **Z-Index Layering**: Resolved "Ghost Clicks" by establishing a strict stacking context for the hamburger menu and the sidebar overlay.

### 3. "State of Mind" (SoM) Formalization

---

* **The Master Context Block**: Defined a "Golden Handshake" for manual AI sessions. This block includes the Master Prompt and the core architecture files (`bootstrap.php`, `pager.php`, `nav-helper.inc.php`) to instantly synchronize any LLM with the project’s strict standards.
* **Manual Handshake Protocol**: Established the "Morning Ritual" (loading MVC context) and "Evening Snapshot" (generating walkthrough summaries) as standard operating procedures.
* **Root README Update**: Successfully integrated the SoM protocol into the main `README.md` to ensure any contributor (human or AI) understands the entry requirements.

### 4. Cleanup & Repository Hygiene

* **Legacy Purge**: Successfully removed `themes/CmsForNerdOld-20260102` and verified that no hardcoded paths remain in the core logic.
* **Versioning**: Finalized the `v3.5.0` milestone with an annotated Git tag and synchronized the `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## 🛠️ Verification Results (v3.5.0)

* **AMP Validation**: Passed via `amp-validator` CLI. All images and sidebar components are compliant.
* **PHPStan Level 8**: Verified. The new Dual-View routing logic preserves strict type-safety and null-safety.
* **Manual Sync Test**: Verified that the "Master Context Block" successfully allows a fresh AI instance to identify "Pair Logic" and "Context Factory" patterns without errors.

## 🔬 Architectural Deep-Dive: SoM Persistence

**The Problem**: Manual AI chats often "forget" the project's strict architectural boundaries (e.g., trying to use `global` variables or standard HTML in an AMP view).
**The Solution**: The **MVC (Minimum Viable Context)** approach. By providing the AI with the three core engine files at the start of every session, we force the LLM to stay within the "Laboratory Bounds."

---

> **Final Sync Check (2026-01-05):** Verified and committed the `v3.5.0` documentation suite. The "State of Mind" protocol is now the official gateway for all development sessions.
> **Mental Anchor (Session End):** The mobile engine is interactive, the security headers are robust, and the AI synchronization protocol is finalized. The repository is in a "Clean & Green" state, ready for next task.

## 🛠️ Verification Results

* **Link Audit**: `SUMMARY.md` was exhaustively checked to ensure all sections are navigable.
* **Architecture Check**: All documentation now correctly references the `CmsContext` factory pattern (`createCmsContext()`).
* **Environment Readiness**: Setup guides now include verified terminal commands for Debian/Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, and Windows (Laravel Herd).

# Architectural Walkthrough: AMP Integration

## The Problem
Maintaining separate HTML files for AMP and Standard views violates the "Pair Logic" and increases technical debt.

## The Solution: Fragment Transformation
We utilize PHP's output buffering to treat the `-body.inc` fragment as a raw data stream.
1. The Controller (`index.php`) initializes the `CmsContext`.
2. The Pager detects `$_GET['view'] === 'amp'`.
3. The Pager captures `pagecontent()` into a variable.
4. `str_replace()` is used to swap `<img>` with `<amp-img>` to satisfy AMP validation while reusing the exact same source fragment.

## Key Files
- `includes/nav-helper.inc.php`: Houses the strict AMP <head> boilerplate.
- `themes/CmsForNerd/pager.php`: The decision engine for view-switching.

The documentation suite is now **100% synchronized** and ready for the v3.5 release milestone.

> **Final Sync Check (2026-01-04):** Verified and committed `docs/AI-STATE-SYNC.md` and `docs/HISTORY.md` to ensure the repository reflects the exact "State of Mind" of the v3.5 release. Use `git log` to verify the commit `docs: sync AI state and history for v3.5 compliance`.

> **Mental Anchor (Session End):** We have fully formalized the "Intelligence Audit" ecosystem. The `master-protocol` is now the Single Source of Truth for agent behavior. The environment is clean, compliant (Level 8), and ready for future "happy flow."

> **Final Sync Check (2026-01-04):** Verified and committed the consolidated Master Protocol ecosystem. The repository now reflects the exact "State of Mind" required for high-availability agentic development.
