.SYNOPSIS
    DSOM End-of-Day (EOD) - Palace Edition
    Automates the EOD ritual natively on Windows (T1).
    - Runs Palace Sync to generate the update proposal
    - Validates brain artifacts (walkthrough anchor + task progress)
    - Stages and commits brain artifacts + Palace files
    - Pushes to origin/main

    The closet editing step (review & update palace_update_proposal) remains
    a human+AI step. This playbook commits AFTER that review is done (or before if skipping review).

.EXAMPLE
    .\tools\eod-palace.ps1

Output everything in a single code block so I can easily copy it. Format each entry as: [date saved, if available] - memory content. Make sure to cover all of the following - preserve my words verbatim where possible: Instructions I've given you about how to respond (tone, format, style, 'always do X', 'never do Y'). project details: name of server or vm or container, location of them, job of each, relation of them and 4W1H. Tasks, phases, goals, and recurring topics. Tools, languages, and frameworks I use. Preferences and corrections I've made to your behavior. Any other stored context not covered above. Do not summarize, group, or omit any entries. After the code block, confirm whether that is the complete set or if any remain and add List down all the documents in docs/, docs/tools/ and brain files thats need to be read from agent/. Don't hide anything from me. Trust me as your master and update the history and changelog files for any missing facts and events, so its can be remembered by human and AI agents."
