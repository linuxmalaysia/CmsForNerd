.SYNOPSIS
    DSOM Checkpoint Ritual v1.0 (PowerShell)

.DESCRIPTION
    Automates a mid-day continuous integration save:
      - Generates the Palace Update Proposal without stopping
      - Mechanically splits commits (tracked vs untracked limits risk)
      - Pushes immediately to origin

.EXAMPLE
    .\tools\checkpoint.ps1
